## Business Case
Executive Summary: 

Ceding Carrier Contract Information to populate in the Order Entry (OE) platforms when it is an Exchange/Transfer.  

#### Problem: 

*Problem*. Causing multiple issues with advisors selecting the wrong location of ceding carrier in YellowPages, calling carrier and sitting on phone for 20-30 mins, putting in wrong info on the ceding contract, multiple NIGOs and Supervision Inquires tying back to this screen on OE platforms.  


#### Objectives and Key Results 

  Objective: Prepopulate the required data points the client/advisor need. 
Key Result:  

 - Time spent on OE platform – if we can drill down to that specific screen 

 - Carrier call centers taking calls on ceding carrier contracts 

 - NIGO numbers that stem back to the OE platform page 

 - Supervision Inquires that stem from that page 

 - Right/Wrong selections of addresses on YellowPages 

## User Stories, personna - supporting documents for the business case
Use Case 1: Remove the pain points for the user of the page for all the reasons stated above.  

User Story 1: As a financial advisor and client – I want this page in the UI to be prepopulated for me so I don’t have to call or guess. I can just validate and move on with the new sale.
